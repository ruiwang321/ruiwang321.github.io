You shall not assign or otherwise transfer the Terms or any right granted hereunder. You also may be subject to additional terms and conditions that may apply when you use A+Player or third-party products or services.</p>
	<p style="margin-left:.25in;">
		14.2 You agree that any material breach of Sections 3, 4, 5, 6 and 10 of the Terms will result in irreparable harm to A+Player for which damages would be an inadequate remedy and, therefore, in addition to its rights and remedies otherwise available at law, A+Player will be entitled to equitable relief, including both a preliminary and permanent injunction, if such a breach occurs. You waive any requirement for the posting of a bond or other security if A+Player seeks such an injunction.</p>
	<p style="margin-left:.25in;">
		14.3 California law and controlling U.S. federal law govern any action related to the Terms and/or your use of the A+Player Property. Choice of law rules of any jurisdiction and the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods will not apply to any dispute under the Terms. You and A+Player agree to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located within the county of Santa Clara, California, U.S.A.</p>
	<p style="margin-left:.25in;">
		14.4 The A+Player Property and products derived or obtained from the A+Player Property may be subject to the U.S. export laws, rules and regulations and the export or import laws, rules and regulations of other countries. You agree to comply strictly with all such laws, rules and regulations and, in particular, shall: (a) obtain any export, reexport, or import authorizations required by U.S. or your local laws; (b) not use A+Player Property or anything derived from the A+Player Property to design, develop or produce missile, chemical/biological, or nuclear weaponry; and (c) not provide A+Player Property or anything derived from the A+Player Property to prohibited countries and entities identified in the U.S. export regulations.</p>
	<p style="margin-left:.25in;">
		14.5 Rights and obligations under the Terms which by their nature should survive will remain in full effect after termination or expiration of the Terms.</p>
	<p style="margin-left:.25in;">
		14.6 Any express waiver or failure to exercise promptly any right under the Terms will not create a continuing waiver or any expectation of non-enforcement. If any provision of the Terms is held invalid by any law or regulation of any government, or by any court or arbitrator, the parties agree that such provision will be replaced with a new provision that accomplishes the original business purpose, and the other provisions of the Terms will remain in full force and effect.</p>
	<p style="margin-left:.25in;">
		14.7 In the event of a conflict between these Terms and any other agreements between you and A+Player, A+Player shall determine in its discretion which terms shall govern.</p>
	<p style="margin-left:.25in;">
		14.9 This English language version of these Terms governs your relationship with A+Player and any translations of the Terms into another language shall not be binding on A+Player.</p>
